      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I've been working in tech sales and support for years, and I've got a little experience with coding from that, but I'm excited to make this into my new career.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I grew up in Scituate, MA - a little ways south of Boston, but I've lived in Washington DC, Los Angeles, and now Seattle.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Cooking and making cocktails. Maybe a little too much of both since quarantine came around.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Something where I can be creative, work on a really great team, and maybe do some teaching and training too.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I'm in Belltown, just around the corner from the Space Needle.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I'm excited to build something that people can use that could make their lives easier. I've worked in tech sales for years, and it's great to help people get set up with what they need, but I'm more excited to be part of the team that's building the thing.</p>
